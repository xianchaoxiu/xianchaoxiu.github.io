  <h1>About Me</h1>  
      <p> Dr. Xiu is an Assistant Professor at Department of Automation, Shanghai University. 
	      I obtained my Ph.D in Operations Research from Beijing Jiaotong University,
	      and then worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Peking University. <br><br>

	      
	      My research interest lies in artificial intelligence and optimization. 
	      I currently focus on data-driven optimization with applications in machine learning, pattern recognition, and robotics. <br><br>
